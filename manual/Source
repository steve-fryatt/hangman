Installing Hangman
------------------

Hangman can be run off a hard disc or floppy disc.

To install Hangman on a hard disc, copy the !Hangman application to a
suitable place on your disc.

Hangman requires Computer Concept's Impression Spell module to be loaded; if
you don't already have this a copy is available from their website or some
magazine cover CDs, in the Impression Junior package (for free).

Using Hangman
-------------

Double click on !Hangman to open the game window and ensure that the game has
input focus by clicking within the window if necessary.  At the top of the
window a row of light blue dashes indicate the word to be guessed, while
below these are a row of dark blue blocks which show how many chances are
left.

To guess a letter, press the key on the keyboard.  If the letter is correct
it will be placed in the correct position in the word; the last letter
entered is highlighted in red.  If the letter was wrong, one chance will be
lost and the letter will be shown in the small box bottom left.

If the player correctly guesses the word, then the letters will turn blue to
show this.  If the chances run out or the player resigns (by clicking on the
Resign icon or pressing Return) then the missing letters will be filled in in
green.

To start a new word, click on the New Word icon or press Return.


Game Options
------------

The Options... item in the menu leads to a small window allowing the level of
the game to be changed.  The entries are fairly self-explanatory: ckick OK to
set.
