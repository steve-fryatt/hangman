<chapter title="Using Hangman" file="Use">

Double click on <file>!Hangman</file> to open the game window and ensure that the game has input focus by clicking within the window if necessary. At the top of the window a row of light blue dashes indicate the word to be guessed, while below these are a row of dark blue blocks which show how many chances are left.

To guess a letter, press the key on the keyboard. If the letter is correct it will be placed in the correct position in the word; the last letter entered is highlighted in red. If the letter was wrong, one chance will be lost and the letter will be shown in the small box bottom left.

If the player correctly guesses the word, then the letters will turn blue to show this. If the chances run out or the player resigns (by clicking on the <icon>Resign</icon> icon or pressing <key>return</key>) then the missing letters will be filled in in green.

To start a new word, click on the <icon>New&nbsp;Word</icon> icon or press <key>return</key>.

</chapter>



<chapter title="Game Options" file="Options">

The <menu>Options...</menu> item in the menu leads to a small window allowing the level of the game to be changed. The entries are fairly self-explanatory: ckick <icon>OK</icon> to set.
