<chapter title="Introduction" file="Intro">

<cite>Hangman</cite> is a desktop implementation of the traditional word-guessing game. At the start of their turn, the player is presented with a random word in which all the letters have been replaced by dashes. Attempts must be made to guess the letters: if a guess is correct then that letter is shown in all its locations, but if wrong a &lsquo;life&rsquo; is lost. If the whole word has been guessed before all the available lives have gone, the player has won.

<chapter title="Installing Hangman" file="Install">

To install <cite>Hangman</cite> on a hard disc, copy the <file>!Hangman</file> application to a suitable place on the disc.

<cite>Hangman</cite> requires Computer Concepts&rsquo; <cite>Impression Spell</cite> module to be loaded before it will run. If you don't already have a copy suitable for your system, a 32-bit version can be found in the OMAP distributions of the <cite>Zap</cite> text editor at <link ref="http://www.tankstage.co.uk/software.html">http://www.tankstage.co.uk/software.html</link>.

<chapter title="Using Hangman" file="Use">

Once installed, double-click on <file>!Hangman</file> to open the game window; ensure that the game has input focus by clicking within the window if necessary. At the top of the window a row of light blue dashes indicates the word to be guessed, while below these are a row of dark blue blocks which show how many guesses are left.

To guess a letter, press the key on the keyboard. If the letter is correct it will be placed in position in the word; the last letter entered is highlighted in red. If the letter is wrong, one chance will be lost and the letter will be shown in the small box to the bottom-left of the window.

If the word is correctly guessed within the required number of tries, then the letters will turn blue to show this. If the chances run out or the player resigns (by clicking on the <icon>Resign</icon> icon or pressing <key>return</key>) then the missing letters will be filled in in green.

To start a new word, click on the <icon>New&nbsp;Word</icon> icon or press <key>return</key> once the game has ended.

</chapter>



<chapter title="Game Options" file="Options">

Selecting <menu>Options...</menu> from the <window>hangman</window> window menu will open the <window>hangman options</window> dialogue.

The <icon>Minimum word lenth</icon> and <icon>Maximum word length</icon> fields set the range of word lengths which will be selected by the game: if these are set too high, then the range of words available will be limited. Note that it is not possible to set the minimum field to more than the maximum, or vice-versa: it might be necessary to adjust the two fields in turn to avoid a conflict.

<icon>Number of guesses</icon> sets the number of incorrect guesses that the game will allow.

Once set, click on <icon>OK</icon> to set the new values or <icon>Cancel</icon> to forget any changes made. The values here will only persist until the main <window>hangman</window> window is closed.
