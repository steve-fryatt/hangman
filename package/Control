Description: Guess words chosen by the computer
 This is a computer version of the 'classic' game, hangman. It doesnâ€™t have
 the graphics (you don't see a little man getting executed), but it does have
 variable difficulty, a large dictionary (as it uses the Computer Concepts'
 Impression Spell module) and quite a good display.
 .
 A copy of the Impression Spell module will be required to use Hangman. A
 version suitable for use on modern RISC OS machines is currently available
 from the ZapSpell module inside the Zap text editor.
